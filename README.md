# COP2220C-Projects-and-HW
These are the projects and homeworks that I had completed during my time in COP2220C.
======================================================================================

Simple multiplication program
- For this assignment, we were tasked to create a simple mulitplication program using loops and user input.

StudentStructStructv2
- For this assingment, we were tasked to create a program that track students courses. The techniques used in this is struct of struct, dynamic allocaiton, pointer aritmetic, input/output, and simple calculation. 

HW2_Nguyen
- For homework 2, we were tasked to create a dignostic program for HVAC compressor. The concepts used in this program is arrays, pointers, functions, random numbers, loops and if statements.

HW3_Nguyen
- For homework 3, we were tasked to manipulate arrays using pointers. 

HW5_Nguyen
- For homework 5, we were tasked to create an engine fan monitoring system using C. The system is meant to control the fan of the engine based on criteria of enigne temperature. The methods used for creating this system was structures, malloc, pointers, and arrays.
